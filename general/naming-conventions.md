# Naming conventions

This document addresses the naming conventions of the project.

## The name

The name **"Gourmetgate"** describes a software product, which enables ordering of products and is designed for the use
in the catering industry.
Gourmetgate is a combination of the word "gourmet" (enjoyer of delicious meals) and "gate" (portal, access enabler).
Both parts start with the same letter for onomatopoeic reasons.

## Display name

**"Gourmetgate"** is the display name of the project. The first letter is upper case. In normal text, when writing about
the project, this spelling shall be used.

## Technical name

**"gourmetgate"** is the technical name of the project. All letters are lower case. When creating e.g. a Java package,
this spelling shall be used.

## Web appearance

There are two official domains which belong to this project.

- On [gourmetgate.app](https://gourmetgate.app), the public website is hosted.
- On [*.gouga.app](https://gouga.app), the instances of the software are hosted. The subdomain indicates the name of the
  customer to which the instance belongs.

## User interface module names

The user interface of the software is separated into modules. A module name is prefixed with "Point of " and has a short
form consisting of the starting letters of the module name. Examples:

- Point of Sale (POS)
- Point of Order (POO)
- Point of Administration (POA)

## Repository naming

(Git) repositories, containing software or documentation have to follow the same pattern. The name shall be a combination of
two words, starting with the same letter. The spelling of the display name and the technical name, in case the repository
contains software, should match the schema of the main Gourmetgate application.
